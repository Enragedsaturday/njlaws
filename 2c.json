Although no culpable mental state is expressly designated in a statute defining an offense, a culpable mental state may nevertheless be required for the commission of such offense, or with respect to some or all of the material elements thereof, if the proscribed conduct necessarily involves such culpable mental state.  A statute defining a crime, unless clearly indicating a legislative intent to impose strict liability, should be construed as defining a crime with the culpability defined in paragraph b.(2) of this section.  This provision applies to offenses defined both within and outside of this code.      d.  Culpability as to illegality of conduct.    Neither knowledge nor recklessness nor negligence as to whether conduct constitutes an offense or as to the existence, meaning or application of the law determining the elements of  an offense is an element of such offense, unless the definition of the offense  or the code so provides.      e.  Culpability as determinant of grade of offense.    When the grade or degree of an offense depends on whether the offense is committed purposely, knowingly, recklessly or criminally negligently, its grade or degree shall be the lowest for which the determinative kind of culpability is established with respect to any material element of the offense.     L.1978, c. 95, s. 2C:2-2, eff.

that there are thousands of persons in this State who are regularly beaten, tortured and in some cases even killed by their spouses or cohabitants; that a significant number of women who are assaulted are pregnant; that victims of domestic violence come from all social and economic backgrounds and ethnic groups; that there is a positive correlation between spousal abuse and child abuse; and that children, even when they are not themselves physically assaulted, suffer deep and lasting emotional effects from exposure to domestic violence.  It is therefore, the intent of the Legislature to assure the victims of domestic violence the maximum protection from abuse the law can provide.      The Legislature further finds and declares that the health and welfare of some of its most vulnerable citizens, the elderly and disabled, are at risk because of incidents of reported and unreported domestic violence, abuse and neglect which are known to include acts which victimize the elderly and disabled emotionally, psychologically, physically and financially; because of age, disabilities or infirmities, this group of citizens frequently must rely on the aid and support of others; while the institutionalized elderly are protected under P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-1 et seq.), elderly and disabled adults in noninstitutionalized or community settings may find themselves victimized by family members or others upon whom they feel compelled to depend.      The Legislature further finds and declares that violence against the elderly and disabled, including criminal neglect of the elderly and disabled under section 1 of P.L.1989, c.23 (C.2C:24-8), must be recognized and addressed on an equal basis as violence against spouses and children in order to fulfill our responsibility as a society to protect those who are less able to protect themselves.      The Legislature further finds and declares that even though many of the existing criminal statutes are applicable to acts of domestic violence, previous societal attitudes concerning domestic violence have affected the response of our law enforcement and judicial systems, resulting in these acts receiving different treatment from similar crimes when they occur in a domestic context.  The Legislature finds that battered adults presently experience substantial difficulty in gaining access to protection from the judicial system, particularly due to that system's inability to generate a prompt response in an emergency situation.      It is the intent of the Legislature to stress that the primary duty of a law enforcement officer when responding to a domestic violence call is to enforce the laws allegedly violated and to protect the victim. Further, it is the responsibility of the courts to protect victims of violence that occurs in a family or family-like setting by providing access to both emergent and long-term civil and criminal remedies and sanctions, and by ordering those remedies and sanctions that are available to assure the safety of the victims and the public.  To that end, the Legislature encourages the training of all police and judicial personnel in the procedures and enforcement of this act, and about the social and psychological context in which domestic violence occurs; and it further encourages the broad application of the remedies available under this act in the civil and criminal courts of this State.  It is further intended that the official response to domestic violence shall communicate the attitude that violent behavior will not be excused or tolerated, and shall make clear the fact that the existing criminal laws and civil remedies created under this act will be enforced without regard to the fact that the violence grows out of a domestic situation.      L.1991,c.261,s.2."},{"id":"2C:25-19","title":"Definitions.","body":"3.   As used in this act:   a.   \"Domestic violence\" means the occurrence of one or more of the following acts inflicted upon a person protected under this act by an adult or an emancipated minor:     (1)   Homicide    N.J.S.2C:11-1 et seq.   (2)   Assault    N.J.S.2C:12-1   (3)   Terroristic threats  N.J.S.2C:12-3   (4)   Kidnapping    N.J.S.2C:13-1   (5)   Criminal restraint    N.J.S.2C:13-2   (6)   False imprisonment    N.J.S.2C:13-3   (7)   Sexual assault    N.J.S.2C:14-2   (8)   Criminal sexual contact  N.J.S.2C:14-3   (9)   Lewdness    N.J.S.2C:14-4   (10) Criminal mischief    N.J.S.2C:17-3   (11) Burglary    N.J.S.2C:18-2   (12) Criminal trespass    N.J.S.2C:18-3   (13) Harassment    N.J.S.2C:33-4   (14) Stalking    P.L.1992, c.209 (C.2C:12-10)   (15) Criminal coercion    N.J.S.2C:13-5   (16) Robbery    N.J.S.2C:15-1   (17) Contempt of a domestic violence order pursuant to subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:29-9 that constitutes a crime or disorderly persons offense    (18) Any other crime involving risk of death or serious bodily injury to a person protected under the \"Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991,\" P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et al.)   (19) Cyber-harassment P.L.2013, c.272 (C.2C:33-4.1)   When one or more of these acts is inflicted by an unemancipated minor upon a person protected under this act, the occurrence shall not constitute \"domestic violence,\" but may be the basis for the filing of a petition or complaint pursuant to the provisions of section 11 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-30).   b.   \"Law enforcement agency\" means a department, division, bureau, commission, board or other authority of the State or of any political subdivision thereof which employs law enforcement officers.   c.   \"Law enforcement officer\" means a person whose public duties include the power to act as an officer for the detection, apprehension, arrest and conviction of offenders against the laws of this State.   d.   \"Victim of domestic violence\" means a person protected under this act and shall include any person who is 18 years of age or older or who is an emancipated minor and who has been subjected to domestic violence by a spouse, former spouse, or any other person who is a present household member or was at any time a household member. \"Victim of domestic violence\" also includes any person, regardless of age, who has been subjected to domestic violence by a person with whom the victim has a child in common, or with whom the victim anticipates having a child in common, if one of the parties is pregnant.  \"Victim of domestic violence\" also includes any person who has been subjected to domestic violence by a person with whom the victim has had a dating relationship.   e.   \"Emancipated minor\" means a person who is under 18 years of age but who has been married, has entered military service, has a child or is pregnant or has been previously declared by a court or an administrative agency to be emancipated.   L.1991,c.261,s.3; amended 1994, c.93, s.1; 1994, c.94, s.1; 2015, c.98, s.2; 2016, c.77, s.1."},{"id":"2C:25-20","title":"Development of training course; curriculum.","body":"4. a.

In enacting the sentencing provisions of the penal code, the Legislature recognized that the imposition of a uniform, consistent and predictable sentence for a given offense is an essential prerequisite to any rational deterrent scheme designed ultimately to reduce the incidence of crime.    b.   Despite the impressive efforts and gains of our law enforcement agencies, the unlawful use, manufacture and distribution of controlled dangerous substances continues to pose a serious and pervasive threat to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of this State.  New Jersey continues to experience an unacceptably high rate of drug-related crime, and continues to serve as a conduit for the illegal trafficking of drugs to and from other jurisdictions.  In addition to the harm suffered by the victims of drug abuse and drug-related crime, the incidence of such offenses is directly related to the rate of other violent and non-violent crimes, including murder, assault, robbery, theft, burglary and organized criminal activities.  For this reason, enhanced and coordinated efforts designed specifically to curtail drug-related offenses will lead inexorably to a reduction in the rate of crime generally, and is therefore decidedly in the public interest.    c.   In order to be effective, the battle against drug abuse and drug-related crime must be waged aggressively at every level along the drug distribution chain, but in particular, our criminal laws must target for expedited prosecution and enhanced punishment those repeat drug offenders and upper echelon members of organized narcotics trafficking networks who pose the greatest danger to society.  In order to ensure the most efficient and effective dedication of limited investigative, prosecutorial, judicial and correctional resources, it is the policy of this State to distinguish between drug offenders based on the seriousness of the offense, considering principally the nature, quantity and purity of the controlled substance involved, and the role of the actor in the overall drug distribution network. It is the intention of the Legislature to provide for the strict punishment, deterrence and incapacitation of the most culpable and dangerous drug offenders, and to facilitate where feasible the rehabilitation of drug dependent persons so as ultimately to reduce the demand for illegal controlled dangerous substances and the incidence of drug-related crime.  It is also the policy of this State to afford special protection to children from the perils of drug trafficking, to ensure that all schools and areas adjacent to schools are kept free from drug distribution activities, and to provide especially stern punishment for those drug offenders who operate on or near schools and school buses, who distribute to juveniles, or who employ juveniles in a drug distribution scheme.  In addition, our criminal laws and sentencing practices must be reexamined and amended so as to minimize pretrial delay, thereby to ensure the prompt disposition of all drug-related criminal charges and the prompt imposition of fair and certain punishment.    d.   Under the current drug laws, there are inadequate sentencing guidelines with which consistently to identify the most serious offenders and offenses and to guard against sentencing disparity and the resulting depreciation of the deterrent thrust of the criminal law.  In order to protect the public interest, and so as to deter, disrupt and eliminate the operation of organized drug trafficking networks, it is necessary to undertake a comprehensive reexamination of our controlled dangerous substances laws, procedures and sentencing practices.  The transfer of the provisions of the \"New Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substances Act,\" P.L. 1970, c. 226 (C. 24:21-1 et seq.) into the penal code which is accomplished herein, along with the amendments and supplements thereto, will better ensure that the most culpable drug offenders will be subject to swift prosecutions and strict, consistently imposed criminal sanctions.    L. 1987, c. 106, s. 1."},{"id":"2C:35-1.2","title":"Reference to Code of Criminal Justice","body":"Whenever in any law, rule or regulation, reference is made to the \"New  Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substances Act,\" P.L. 1970, c. 226 (C. 24:21-1  et seq.) or any part thereof, the same shall mean and refer to the appropriate chapter, section or provision of the \"New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice\" as amended and supplemented herein.  Similarly, any reference to chapter 35 or 36 in the \"New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice\" shall be deemed to  incorporate P.L.1970, c.226 (C.24:21-1 et seq.) or any other predecessor  statute.     L. 1987, c. 106, s. 24."},{"id":"2C:35-2","title":"Definitions.","body":""},{"id":"2C:35-3","title":"Leader of Narcotics Trafficking Network","body":"2C:35-3.  Leader of Narcotics Trafficking Network.   As used in this section:   \"Financier\" means a person who, with the intent to derive a profit, provides money or credit or other thing of value in order to purchase a controlled dangerous substance or an immediate precursor, or otherwise to finance the operations of a drug trafficking network.   A person is a leader of a narcotics trafficking network if he conspires with two or more other persons in a scheme or course of conduct to unlawfully manufacture, distribute, dispense, bring into or transport in this State methamphetamine, lysergic acid diethylamide, phencyclidine, gamma hydroxybutyrate, flunitrazepam or any controlled dangerous substance classified in Schedule I or II, or any controlled substance analog thereof as a financier, or as an organizer, supervisor or  manager of at least one other person.   Leader of narcotics trafficking network is a crime of the first degree and upon conviction thereof, except as may be provided by N.J.S.2C:35-12, a person shall be sentenced to an ordinary term of life imprisonment during which the person must serve 25 years before being eligible for parole.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-3, the court may also impose a fine not to exceed $750,000.00 or five times the street value of the controlled dangerous substance, controlled substance analog, gamma hydroxybutyrate or flunitrazepam involved, whichever is greater.   Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.2C:1-8, a conviction of leader of narcotics trafficking network shall not merge with the conviction for any offense which is the object of the conspiracy.

shall be known and may be cited as the \"Anti-Drug Profiteering Act.\"    L.1997,c.187,s.2."},{"id":"2C:35A-2","title":"Declaration of Policy and Legislative Findings.","body":"2C:35A-2.  Declaration of policy and legislative findings.   The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:   a.  Persons who engage in drug trafficking activities for profit are a form of professional criminal, and deserve enhanced punishment that is specially adapted to remove the economic incentives inherent in such criminal activities.   b.  It shall be the overriding objective of the provisions of this chapter to eliminate to the greatest extent possible the economic incentives inherent in commercial drug distribution activities at all levels within the drug distribution chain.  In order to accomplish this objective, it is appropriate to impose stern economic sanctions in the form of monetary penalties against certain convicted drug offenders.  So as to ensure that such economic sanctions are specially adapted and proportionate to the true nature, extent and profitability of the specific criminal activities involved, such monetary penalties should in appropriate cases be based upon a multiple of the street level value of all the illicit substances involved.  The use of such a mechanism for calculating an appropriate monetary penalty will help to offset and overcome the perception of some drug offenders, and especially those who are well insulated within a drug trafficking network, that they face only a comparatively low risk of immediate detection and punishment.  The Legislature, by adoption of the \"Comprehensive Drug Reform Act,\" N.J.S.2C:35-1 et al.,  recognized the utility of such a mechanism by providing for the imposition of discretionary cash fines which may be based upon three, or in some cases five, times the street value of the illicit drugs involved.   c.  The imposition of monetary penalties pursuant to this act is intended to serve as an adjunct to forfeiture actions, which are designed to deprive offenders of the proceeds of their criminal activities and of all property used in furtherance of or to facilitate such illegal activities.  While the seizure and forfeiture of property in accordance with the provisions of chapters 41 and 64 of this Title and P.L.1994, c.121 (money laundering) remain a critically important means by which to reduce the economic incentive inherent in drug trafficking activities, in many instances, given the efforts undertaken by offenders to conceal and disguise assets and to resort to complex financial transactions and money laundering schemes,  it has become increasingly difficult for law enforcement agencies to establish to the required degree of certainty that a given asset or interest in property is subject to forfeiture.  Accordingly, it is necessary and appropriate to impose an in personam debt against the defendant which may be satisfied by proceeding against any asset or interest in property belonging to the defendant, whether or not such property can be directly or indirectly linked to criminal activity.   d.  In order to ensure the maximum deterrent effect of imposing such specially adapted economic sanctions as are required pursuant to the provisions of this act, it shall be the policy of this State to enforce the judgment and to collect the entire debt, or the greatest possible portion thereof, as soon as is feasible following the imposition of the penalty, taking full advantage, where necessary, of this State's long arm jurisdiction and the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution of the United States.   L.1997,c.187,s.2"},{"id":"2C:35A-3","title":"Criteria for imposition of anti-drug profiteering penality","body":"2C:35A-3.  Criteria

provisions of N.J.S.2C:43-3 and except as may be provided by section 5 of this chapter, where a person has been convicted of a crime defined in chapter 35 or 36 of this Title or any crime involving criminal street gang related activity as defined in subsection h. of N.J.S.2C:44-3 or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime, the court shall, upon the application of the prosecutor, sentence the person to pay a monetary penalty in an amount determined pursuant to section 4 of this chapter, provided the court finds at a hearing, which may occur at the time of sentencing, that the prosecutor has established by a preponderance of the evidence one or more of the grounds specified in this section.  The findings of the court shall be incorporated in the record, and in making its findings, the court shall take judicial notice of any evidence, testimony or information adduced at the trial, plea hearing or other court proceedings and shall also consider the presentence report and any other relevant information.   b.   Any of the following shall constitute grounds for imposing an Anti-Drug Profiteering Penalty:   (1)  The defendant was convicted of: (a) a violation of N.J.S.2C:35-3 (leader of narcotics trafficking network), or (b) a violation of subsection g. of N.J.S.2C:5-2 (leader of organized crime), or (c) an offense defined in chapter 41 of this Title (racketeering) which involved the manufacture, distribution, possession with intent to distribute or transportation of any controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog.     (2) The defendant is a drug profiteer. A defendant is a drug profiteer when the conduct constituting the crime shows that the person has knowingly engaged in the illegal manufacture, distribution or transportation of any controlled dangerous substance, controlled substance analog or drug paraphernalia as a substantial source of livelihood.  In making its determination, the court may consider all of the attending circumstances, including but not limited to the defendant's role in the criminal activity, the nature, amount and purity of the substance involved, the amount of cash or currency involved, the extent and accumulation of the defendant's assets during the course of the criminal activity and the defendant's net worth and his expenditures in relation to his legitimate sources of income.   (3)  The defendant is a wholesale drug distributor.  (a) A defendant is a wholesale drug distributor when the conduct constituting the crime involves the manufacture, distribution or intended or attempted distribution of a controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog to any other person for pecuniary gain, knowing, believing, or under circumstances where it reasonably could be assumed that such other person would in turn distribute the substance to another or others for pecuniary gain.  It shall not be necessary for the prosecution to establish to whom the substance was distributed or intended or attempted to be distributed, and the court may draw all reasonable inferences from the nature of the defendant's conduct and the substance involved that such other person, while not specifically identified, would in turn distribute the substance to another or others for pecuniary gain.  In making its determination, the court shall consider all of the attending circumstances, including but not limited to the defendant's role in the criminal activity, the nature, amount and purity of the substance involved, and the likelihood that a substance of such purity would be intended to be distributed directly to the ultimate consumer of the substance.   (b)  Notwithstanding that the prosecutor has established that the defendant is a wholesale drug distributor within the meaning of this paragraph, the court shall not impose an anti-drug profiteering penalty on that ground if the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence at the hearing that his participation in the conduct constituting the crime was limited solely to operating a conveyance used to transport a controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog, or loading or unloading the substance into such a conveyance or storage facility.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to establish a basis for not imposing a penalty where the prosecutor has established any other ground or grounds specified in this section for the imposition of an anti-drug profiteering penalty.   (4)  The defendant is a professional drug distributor.  A professional drug distributor is a person who has at any time, for pecuniary gain, unlawfully distributed a controlled dangerous substance, controlled substance analog or drug paraphernalia to three or more different persons, or on five or more separate occasions regardless of the number of persons to whom the substance or paraphernalia was distributed.   (5) The defendant was involved in criminal street gang related activity.   c.   In making its determination, the court may rely upon expert opinion in the form of live testimony or by affidavit, or by such other means as the court deems appropriate.   d.   For the purposes of this chapter, an act is undertaken for pecuniary gain if it involves or contemplates the transfer of anything of value in exchange for a controlled dangerous substance, controlled substance analog or drug paraphernalia, provided that the thing of value received or intended to be received in exchange for the substance or paraphernalia is or was reasonably believed to be of a higher value than that expended by the defendant or by any other person with whom the actor is acting in concert, to acquire or manufacture the substance or paraphernalia.  It shall also include any act which would constitute a violation of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-5, N.J.S.2C:35-11, N.J.S.2C:36-3 or any other crime for which the actor was paid or expected to be paid in return for performing such act, or from which the actor received a benefit for himself or another or injured another or deprived another of a benefit. There shall be a rebuttable presumption at the hearing that any manufacturing, distribution or possession with intent to distribute which contemplates or involves the payment or exchange of anything of value constitutes an act undertaken for pecuniary gain.  It shall not be necessary for the prosecution to establish that any intended profit or payment was actually received; nor shall it be relevant that the act, payment in return for such act or the transfer of anything of value in exchange for the substance or paraphernalia, occurred or was intended to occur in another jurisdiction.   L.1997,c.187,s.2; amended 1999, c.160, s.2."},{"id":"2C:35A-4","title":"Calculation of anti-drug profiteering penalty","body":"2C:35A-4.  Calculation of anti-drug profiteering

controlled dangerous substances.  Because of this threat, a person who has assets unrelated to the sale of controlled dangerous substances, who markets controlled dangerous substances at the

The purpose of N.J.S.2C:43-12 through N.J.S.2C:43-22 is to effectuate a Statewide program of Pretrial Intervention.  It is the policy of the State of New Jersey that supervisory treatment should ordinarily be limited to persons who have not previously been convicted of any criminal offense under the laws of New Jersey, or under any criminal law of the United States, or any other state when supervisory treatment would:   (1)   Provide applicants, on an equal basis, with opportunities to avoid ordinary prosecution by receiving early rehabilitative services or supervision, when such services or supervision can reasonably be expected to deter future criminal behavior by an applicant, and when there is apparent causal connection between the offense charged and the rehabilitative or supervisory need, without which cause both the alleged offense and the need to prosecute might not have occurred; or   (2)   Provide an alternative to prosecution for applicants who might be harmed by the imposition of criminal sanctions as presently administered, when such an alternative can be expected to serve as sufficient sanction to deter criminal conduct; or   (3)   Provide a mechanism for permitting the least burdensome form of prosecution possible for defendants charged with \"victimless\" offenses, other than defendants who were public officers or employees charged with offenses that involved or touched their office or employment; or   (4)   Provide assistance to criminal calendars in order to focus expenditure of criminal justice resources on matters involving serious criminality and severe correctional problems; or   (5)   Provide deterrence of future criminal or disorderly behavior by an applicant in a program of supervisory treatment.   b. (1) Admission of an applicant into a program of supervisory treatment shall be measured according to the applicant's amenability to correction, responsiveness to rehabilitation and the nature of the offense.   (2)   There shall be a presumption against admission into a program of supervisory treatment for:    (a)   a defendant who was a public officer or employee whose offense involved or touched upon his public office or employment; and   (b)   a defendant charged with any crime or offense involving domestic violence, as defined in subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19) if the defendant committed the crime or offense while subject to a temporary or permanent restraining order issued pursuant to the provisions of the \"Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991,\" P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et al.) or if the crime or offense charged involved violence or the threat of violence.  For purposes of this subparagraph, a crime or offense involves violence or the threat of violence if the victim sustains serious or significant bodily injury as defined in subsection b. or d. of N.J.S.2C:11-1, or the actor is armed with and uses a deadly weapon or threatens by word or gesture to use a deadly weapon as defined in subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:11-1, or threatens to inflict serious or significant bodily injury.   c.   The decision and reasons therefor made by the designated judges (or assignment judges), prosecutors and program directors in granting or denying applications for supervisory treatment, in recommending and ordering termination from the program or dismissal of charges, in all cases shall be reduced to writing and disclosed to the applicant.   d.   If an applicant desires to challenge the decision of the prosecutor or program director not to recommend enrollment in a program of supervisory treatment the proceedings prescribed under N.J.S.2C:43-14 and in accordance with the Rules of Court shall be followed.   e.   Referral.  At any time prior to trial but after the filing of a criminal complaint, or the filing of an accusation or the return of an indictment, with the consent of the prosecutor and upon written recommendation of the program director, the assignment judge or a judge designated by him may postpone all further proceedings against an applicant and refer said applicant to a program of supervisory treatment approved by the Supreme Court.

Each applicant for supervisory treatment shall be entitled to full and fair consideration of his application.  If an application is denied, the program director or the prosecutor shall precisely state his findings and conclusion which shall include the facts upon which the application is based and the reasons offered for the denial.  If the applicant desires to challenge the decision of a program director not to recommend, or of a prosecutor not to consent to, enrollment into a supervisory treatment program, a motion shall be filed before the designated judge (or assignment judge) authorized pursuant to the Rules of Court to enter orders.   g.   Limitations.  (1) Supervisory treatment may occur only once with respect to any defendant and any person who has previously received supervisory treatment under section 27 of P.L.1970, c.226 (C.24:21-27), a conditional discharge pursuant to N.J.S.2C:36A-1, a conditional dismissal pursuant to P.L.2013, c.158 (C.2C:43-13.1 et al.), or was granted a dismissal due to successful participation in the Veterans Diversion Program pursuant to P.L.2017, c.42 (C.2C:43-23 et al.) shall not be eligible for supervisory treatment under this section.    (2)   Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, supervisory treatment, as provided herein, shall be available to a defendant irrespective of whether the defendant contests his guilt of the charge or charges against him.   (3)   Admission into supervisory treatment shall be available to the following defendants only upon entering a plea of guilty: (a) a defendant charged with a first or second degree crime; (b) a defendant charged with any crime if the defendant had previously been convicted of a first or second degree crime; (c) a defendant charged with a third or fourth degree crime involving domestic violence, as defined in subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19); or (d) a defendant charged with any disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offense involving domestic violence, as defined in subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19) if the defendant committed the offense while subject to a temporary or permanent restraining order issued pursuant to the provisions of the \"Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991,\" P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et al.).  For any such defendant, following the plea of guilty the plea shall be held in an inactive status pending termination of supervisory treatment pursuant to subsection d. or e. of N.J.S.2C:43-13.
