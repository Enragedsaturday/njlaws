Legislature finds and declares that:   a.   The Division of Motor Vehicle Services (DMV) is one of the State's principal customer service agencies with regular and direct contact with virtually every citizen;   b.   The DMV has over 15 million contacts a year with the public, including 39 million transactions, more than any other State agency;   c.   The DMV has responsibility for issuing and certifying motor vehicle driver's licenses, ensuring the proper registration of motor vehicles, as well as conducting safety and emissions inspections of motor vehicles;   d.   The public expects courteous, efficient and accessible service from government agencies, including the DMV;   e.   The DMV's failed security systems are contributing to a growing national problem of identity theft that is costing New Jersey and the nation millions of dollars each week;   f.   In the past, the DMV has been unable to deal with fraud and corruption because of inadequate funding, training, security, internal controls and oversight;   g.   The DMV must improve its security system and equipment, and its fraud detection, training and monitoring so that fraudulent driver's licenses, such as those used in the furtherance of terroristic activities, will be eliminated;   h.   Internal audits and controls and investigations are also needed to detect patterns of fraud, theft, corruption, identity theft and mismanagement in the issuance of driver's licenses, registrations, and titles because DMV documents must be more resistant to compromise;   i.   Criminals have used counterfeit passports, Social Security cards, county identification cards, pay stubs and W-2 forms to obtain fraudulent driver's licenses and identification cards in furtherance of identity-theft schemes;   j.   Proper identification must be required at all phases of the licensing and driver testing process to assure that only those persons qualified to legally obtain licenses do so;   k.   It is essential that DMV records be matched with Social Security Administration records, when presented, in order to verify the validity of Social Security numbers in DMV databases;   l.   Cameras, armed security guards, panic buttons, alarms, safety upgrades, card access systems and door replacements are needed in order to prevent fraud;   m.   Employees or agents of the DMV should be required to undergo background checks and fingerprinting;   n.   Cleaning crews and maintenance workers at DMV facilities must be supervised by DMV employees to ensure the security of DMV records;   o.   In a time of rapidly changing information technology and Internet communications, the DMV lacks an information technology plan to bring it to the 21st Century and still operates on a decades-old computer network with patchwork hardware, antiquated software and obsolete display terminals that lack processing abilities;   p.   Previous DMV efforts to implement complex technological mandates have failed, due to bureaucratic mismanagement, inefficient planning and inadequate oversight, as characterized by reports of the State Commission of Investigation;   q.   The DMV has become a reactive agency, struggling to keep up with the demands of newly legislated responsibilities, and without the necessary resources to prevent fraud and corruption at its front-line agencies and without the ability to provide even adequate service to its six million customers;   r.   The DMV needs a strategic business plan, which is a key to the operation of an agency, and must work within the confines of such plan in an effort to adopt best practices, improve customer service and gain back the confidence of New Jersey citizens and the Legislature;   s.   The DMV's privatization of some of its agencies in July 1995 has created poor, disjointed and confused service delivery without consistency among the agencies in terms of policies and procedures, which has led to confusion and frustration in the minds of New Jersey citizens;   t.   The DMV privatization has also resulted in poorly paid employees who have received inadequate benefits, resulting in a high turnover rate at DMV agencies;   u.   A major benefit to a State-operated DMV system is the ability to centralize anti-fraud policies and procedures;   v.   Historically, the privately-operated local motor vehicle agencies have been plagued with long lines, poor customer service and inadequate business practices that have routinely caused network delays and failures for hours at a time;   w.   The DMV would be in a better position to plan for long-term improvements, replacements and daily operations if it had a dedicated and consistent source of funding;   x.   In order to address the various problems with the DMV, a \"FIX DMV Commission\" was formed on April 25, 2002, by Governor's Executive Order Number 19 to conduct a comprehensive review of the DMV and to make recommendations on the restructuring and reorganization of the agency;   y.   The \"FIX DMV Commission\" has reported that the DMV is in crisis and has recommended that a New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission be formed in, but not of, the Department of Transportation to replace the current New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles with the purposes of: (1) identifying and regulating drivers and motor vehicles to deter unlawful and unsafe acts; (2) identifying and correcting vehicle defects and limiting the amount of vehicle-produced air pollution; (3) focusing on and responding to customer service and security issues; and (4) effectuating change by bringing greater attention and resources to the needs of the organization;   z.   It is therefore in the public interest to create a New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, the duties of which would include, but not be limited to:  (1) addressing the multitude of functions assigned to it while curtailing fraudulent and criminal activities that present threats to the State's security system; (2) following a multi-year strategic business plan that is constantly reviewed and updated, thus avoiding the need for the cyclical reforms that have characterized its history; and (3) conducting operations on a fiscal year budget, controlling fees sufficient to fund the budget, adopting regulations regarding processes and fees; and implementing an annual strategic business plan.   L.2003,

An applicant for a permit or license who is under 18 years of age, and who holds a permit or license for a passenger automobile issued by another state or country that is valid or has expired within a time period designated by the commission, shall be subject to the permit and license requirements and penalties applicable to State permit and license applicants who are of the same age; except that if the other state or country has permit or license standards substantially similar to those of this State, the credentials of the other state or country shall be acceptable.   j. (1) The commission shall create classified licensing of drivers covering the following classifications:   (a) Motorcycles, except that for the purposes of this section, motorcycle shall not include any three-wheeled motor vehicle equipped with a single cab with glazing enclosing the occupant, seats similar to those of a passenger vehicle or truck, seat belts and automotive steering or any vehicle defined as a motorcycle pursuant to R.S.39:1-1 having a motor with a maximum piston displacement that is less than 50 cubic centimeters or a motor that is rated at no more than 1.5 brake horsepower with a maximum speed of no more than 35 miles per hour on a flat surface.   (b) Omnibuses as classified by R.S.39:3-10.1 and school buses classified under N.J.S.18A:39-1 et seq.   (c) (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1999, c.28)   (d) All motor vehicles not included in classifications (a) and (b).  A license issued pursuant to this classification d. shall be referred to as the \"basic driver's license\" and may be issued as a standard basic driver's license or a REAL ID basic driver's license.   (2)   Every applicant for a license under classification b. shall be a holder of a basic driver's license.  Any issuance of a license under classification b. shall be by endorsement on the person's basic driver's license.   (3)   A driver's license for motorcycles may be issued separately, but if issued to the holder of a basic driver's license, it shall be by endorsement on the person's basic driver's license.  The holder of a basic driver's license or a separately issued motorcycle license shall be authorized to operate a motorcycle having a motor with a maximum piston displacement that is less than 50 cubic centimeters or a motor that is rated at no more than 1.5 brake horsepower with a maximum speed no more than 35 miles per hour on a flat surface.     k.   The commission, upon payment of the lawful fee and after it or a person authorized by it has examined the applicant and is satisfied of the applicant's ability as an operator, may, in its discretion, issue a license to the applicant to drive a motor vehicle.  The license shall authorize the person to drive any registered vehicle, of the kind or kinds indicated.   l.   The license shall expire, except as otherwise provided, during the fourth calendar year following the date in which the license was issued and on the same calendar day as the person's date of birth.  If the person's date of birth does not correspond to a calendar day of the fourth calendar year, the license shall expire on the last day of the person's birth month.   The commission may, at its discretion and for good cause shown, issue licenses that expire on a date fixed by it.  If the commission issues a REAL ID basic driver's license or REAL ID motorcycle license to a person who has demonstrated authorization to be present in the United States for a period of time shorter than the standard period of the license, the commission shall fix the expiration date of the license at a date based on the period in which the person is authorized to be present in the United States under federal immigration laws. The commission may renew the person's REAL ID basic driver's license or REAL ID motorcycle license only if it is demonstrated that the person's continued presence in the United States is authorized under federal law.  The fee for licenses with expiration dates fixed by the commission shall be fixed by the commission in amounts proportionately less or greater than the fee herein established.   m.   The required fee for a license for the license period shall be as follows, subject to adjustment pursuant to section 16 of P.L.2007, c.335 (C.39:2A-36.1):      Standard motorcycle license or endorsement: $18.      REAL ID motorcycle license: $29.      Omnibus or school bus endorsement: $18.      Standard basic driver's license: $18.      REAL ID basic driver's license: $29.   The commission shall waive the payment of fees for issuance of omnibus endorsements whenever an applicant establishes to the commission's satisfaction that the applicant will use the omnibus endorsement exclusively for operating omnibuses owned by a nonprofit organization duly incorporated under Title 15 or 16 of the Revised Statutes or Title 15A of the New Jersey Statutes.   n.   The commission shall issue licenses for the following license period on and after the first day of the calendar month immediately preceding the commencement of the period, the licenses to be effective immediately.   o.   All applications for renewals of licenses shall be made in a manner prescribed by the commission and in accordance with procedures established by it.   p.   The commission in its discretion may refuse to grant a permit or license to drive motor vehicles to a person who is, in its estimation, not a proper person to be granted a permit or license, but a defect of the applicant shall not debar the applicant from receiving a permit or license unless it can be shown by tests approved by the commission that the defect incapacitates the applicant from safely operating a motor vehicle.   q.   A person issued a basic driver's license pursuant to this section may be issued a standard basic driver's license or a REAL ID basic driver's license.  The chief administrator shall require an applicant for a standard basic driver's license to provide as proof of the applicant's identity, age, and residence primary and secondary documents, with which the chief administrator shall attribute point values in accordance with the point based identification verification program established pursuant to section 28 of P.L.2003, c.13 (C.39:2A-28).  The point total required to prove the identity of an applicant for the standard basic driver's license shall be the same for every applicant, regardless of immigration status.  In the event that the commission changes the point total threshold, the requirement that every applicant reach the same point total threshold shall remain in effect.   r.   In addition to requiring an applicant for a driver's license to submit satisfactory proof of identity and age, the commission also shall require the applicant to provide:    (1)   as a condition for obtaining a permit and standard basic driver's license, proof of the person's social security number and one document providing satisfactory proof that the applicant is a New Jersey resident.  If the person does not have a social security number, the person shall either:    (a)   provide satisfactory proof of an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number; or    (b)   indicate, in a manner prescribed by the commission and consistent with all other provisions of P.L.2019, c.271 (C.39:3-10o et al.), that the person is not eligible to receive a social security number; or   (2)   as a condition for obtaining a REAL ID basic driver's license: two documents providing satisfactory proof that the applicant is a New Jersey resident; proof of the applicant's social security number or verification of ineligibility for a social security number in accordance with the \"REAL ID Act of 2005,\" Pub.L.109-13, any acts amendatory or supplementary thereto, and any federal regulations adopted thereunder; and proof that the applicant's presence in the United States is authorized under federal law.    s.   A standard basic driver's license shall indicate that the license shall not be accepted as identification for an official purpose, as that term is defined under the \"REAL ID Act of 2005,\" Pub.L.109-13, any acts amendatory or supplementary thereto, and any federal regulations adopted thereunder.   t.   If the commission has reasonable cause to suspect that any document presented by an applicant pursuant to this section is altered, false, or otherwise invalid, the commission shall refuse to grant the permit or license until the time when the document may be verified by the issuing agency to the commission's satisfaction.   u.   A person violating this section shall be subject to a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 60 days, but if that person has never been licensed to drive in this State or any other jurisdiction, the applicant shall be subject to a fine of not less than $200 and, in addition, the court shall issue an order to the commission requiring the commission to refuse to issue a license to operate a motor vehicle to the person for a period of not less than 180 days.  The penalties provided for by this paragraph shall not be applicable in cases where failure to have actual possession of the operator's license is due to an administrative or technical error by the commission.   v.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter or extend the expiration of any license issued prior to the date this amendatory and supplementary act becomes operative.   w.   Any documents and personal information, including an applicant's photograph, obtained by the commission from an applicant for a standard basic driver's license or standard motorcycle license shall be confidential, shall not be considered a government record pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-5 et al.), or the common law concerning access to government records, and shall not be disclosed by the commission for any purpose related to Title 8 of the United States Code without the informed consent of the applicant, a warrant signed by a State or federal judge, or a lawful court order or subpoena; except that nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit, or in any way restrict, any action where such prohibition or restriction would be contrary to federal law; and except that information under this subsection may be shared in accordance with section 2 of P.L.2021, c.139 (C.39:2-3.9).  When responding to a warrant, court order, or subpoena, the commission may disclose only those records or information specifically requested in the warrant, court order, or subpoena.   Possession of a standard basic driver's license or standard motorcycle license issued pursuant to this section shall not be considered evidence of an individual's citizenship or immigration status and shall not be used as a basis for an investigation, arrest, citation, prosecution, or detention.    Information regarding an applicant's Individual Tax Identification Number, social security number, or ineligibility to receive a social security number obtained by the commission for the issuance of a standard motorcycle license or standard basic driver's license pursuant to this section, shall not be considered a government record pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-5 et al.), or the common law concerning access to government records, and shall not be disclosed by the commission except where: (1) required by section 11 of P.L.1998, c.1 (C.2A:17-56.60); (2) the applicant provides written informed consent to the disclosure; (3) the requesting entity presents a warrant signed by a State or federal judge, a lawful court order, or a subpoena; (4) required by State or federal law, and to the extent that the disclosure may be necessary to permit the State to participate in the National Driver Register program, as set forth in 49 U.S.C. s.30301 et seq.; (5) the disclosure is in connection with an audit or investigation of identity fraud, driver's license fraud, or non-driver identification card fraud; or (6) consistent with section 2 of P.L.2021, c.139 (C.39:2-3.9).   x.   As used in this section:    \"Parking sensors\" means proximity sensors which use either electromagnetic or ultrasonic technology and are designed to alert the driver to obstacles while parking.    \"Rear visibility system\" means devices or components installed on a motor vehicle at the time of manufacture that allow a forward facing driver to view a visual image of the area directly behind the vehicle.   Amended 1938, c.66, s.6;

declares:   a.   Route 130 is one of the most dangerous roadways in the State for pedestrians, evidenced by the fact that it was adjudged the most dangerous roadway in New Jersey by the Tri-State Transportation Campaign for five consecutive years from 2011 to 2015.   b.   Since 2009, Route 130 has never ranked lower than second on the Tri-State Transportation Campaign's list of most dangerous roadways for pedestrians.   c.   The portion of Route 130 in Burlington City, Burlington County is particularly dangerous because its northbound and southbound lanes are separated by a block of commercial properties that contains several popular locales, including a prominent convenience store, two fast food restaurants, two pizza places, a pharmacy, an omelette house, and an ice cream parlor.   d.   In addition, Burlington City High School is directly adjacent to the northbound lanes of Route 130 in Burlington City and the Wilbur Watts Intermediate School is directly adjacent to the southbound lanes of Route 130 in Burlington City.   e.   A large portion of the Burlington City High School student body resides west of Route 130, necessitating many students of the high school to cross Route 130 in order to get to and from school.   f.   The proximity of the northbound and southbound lanes to the two schools, the existence of several commercial properties frequented by members of the student body of those two schools and by residents of the city, and the fact that many students cross Route 130 in order to get to and from school creates a dangerous set of circumstances that threatens the safety of the students and residents of Burlington City.   g.   Although the speed limit is reduced to 25 miles per hour on a portion of Route 130 in Burlington City when the presence of children is clearly visible from the roadway during recess or while children are going to or leaving school during opening or closing hours for the Burlington City High School and the Wilbur Watts Intermediate school, the speed limit is 40 miles per hour at all other times.   h.   On May 22, 2016, Antwan Timbers, Jr. was returning home, after visiting one of the popular convenience stores located between the northbound and southbound lanes of Route 130 in Burlington City, when he was struck and killed by a passing motorist.   i.   Antwan, a beloved member of his school and community, planned to play football and wrestle during the 2016-2017 school year, was a participant in Burlington City High School's Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, and had expressed interest in joining the military after graduation.   j.   Following his tragic death, Antwan's friends and schoolmates banded together to start a \"25 Saves Lives\" campaign, calling for a permanent, full-day reduction in the speed limit in the school zone along Route 130 in Burlington City.   k.   The speed limit of 40 miles per hour on the portion of Route 130 adjacent to the Burlington City High School and the Wilbur Watts Intermediate School is too high and, accordingly, needs to be permanently reduced in the interest of public safety.   L.2019, c.5,

If the preliminary hearing is otherwise postponed or delayed solely at the instance of someone other than the individual charged, the judge shall immediately order that the individual's license certificate or any nonresident reciprocity privilege be restored pending the rescheduled preliminary hearing.   At the preliminary hearing, the parties shall proceed on the papers submitted to the judge, including the summons, the police reports and the charged individual's prior driving record submitted by the division, and any brief affidavits permitted by the judge from persons who shall be witnesses at the final hearing, and the parties may present oral arguments.  Based on the papers, on any oral argument, on the individual's prior driving record, and on the circumstances of the alleged violation presented in the papers, the judge shall immediately determine whether the individual was properly charged with a violation of the law and a death occurred; and, if so, whether in the interest of public safety, the preliminary suspension shall be continued pending the final agency decision on the matter.  The administrative law judge shall transmit his findings to the director.   Any plenary hearing to contest the proposed final agency action shall conform to the requirements for a plenary hearing contained in subsection b. of this section.   f.   In addition to any other final agency action, the director shall require any person whose privileges to operate a motor vehicle or motorized bicycle are suspended or who has been prohibited from obtaining a license, pursuant to this section, to be reexamined to determine the person's ability to operate a motor vehicle or motorized bicycle, prior to regaining or obtaining any driving privileges in this State.   Any determination resulting from any preliminary or plenary hearing held pursuant to subsection b., c., or e. of this section shall not be admissible at any criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings on the alleged violation or violations.   g.   In addition to any other requirements imposed by statute or regulation, as a condition for the restoration of a revoked or suspended license issued under the provisions of the \"New Jersey Commercial Driver License Act,\" P.L.1990, c.103 (C.39:3-10.9 et seq.), the person whose commercial driving privileges are revoked or suspended shall successfully complete a commercial driver improvement program.  The director, in accordance with the provisions of the \"Administrative Procedure Act,\" P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall promulgate rules and regulations prescribing the scope and content of the program, the qualifications of third parties that may offer a commercial driver improvement program, a fee schedule for persons attending a commercial driver improvement program and such other matters as the director may deem appropriate and necessary.  The successful completion of a commercial driver improvement program pursuant to this subsection shall not entitle a person to any reduction in the points assessed and recorded under P.L.1982, c.43 (C.39:5-30.5 et seq.).  In addition, the director may also require a person holding a commercial driver's license pursuant to P.L.1990, c.103 (C.39:3-10.9 et seq.) who receives 12 or more points during a 24-month period to complete a commercial driver improvement program successfully or face full suspension of the commercial driver's license driving privilege.   Amended 1939, c.216, s.2; 1945, c.256; 1979, c.463, s.2; 1982, c.43, s.8; 1990, c.103, s.33; 2003, c.131, s.3."},{"id":"39:5-30a","title":"Habitual offender defined","body":"As used in this act:     \"Habitual offender\"  means a person who has his license to operate a motor  vehicle suspended three times for violations occurring within a 3-year period.     L.1982, c. 85, s. 1, eff.

The rate established by the commissioner shall be sufficient to reimburse the insurer for the cost of writing the policy and an amount set by the commissioner to be forwarded to the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund to offset claims paid by the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund.  The commissioner may adjust the rate annually.   f.   Special automobile insurance policies shall be assigned to insurers pursuant to the apportionment methodology of the plan created pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1970, c.215 (C.17:29D-1).  The number of policies assigned pursuant to this subsection shall not be included in the determination of a competitive market pursuant to subsection d. of section 27 of P.L.1990, c.8 (C.17:33B-15).   L.2003,c.89,s.45."},{"id":"39:6A-4","title":"Personal injury protection coverage, regardless of fault.","body":"4.   Personal injury protection coverage, regardless of fault.   Except as provided by section 45 of P.L.2003, c.89 (C.39:6A-3.3) and section 4 of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.39:6A-3.1), every standard automobile liability insurance policy issued or renewed on or after the effective date of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.39:6A-1.1 et al.) shall contain personal injury protection benefits for the payment of benefits without regard to negligence, liability or fault of any kind, to the named insured and members of his family residing in his household who sustain bodily injury as a result of an accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile, or as a pedestrian, caused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or from an automobile, and to other persons sustaining bodily injury while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using the automobile of the named insured, with permission of the named insured.   \"Personal injury protection coverage\" means and includes:   a.   Payment of medical expense benefits in accordance with a benefit plan provided in the policy and approved by the commissioner, for reasonable, necessary, and appropriate treatment and provision of services to persons sustaining bodily injury, in an amount not to exceed $250,000 per person per accident.  In the event benefits paid by an insurer pursuant to this subsection are in excess of $75,000 on account of bodily injury to any one person in any one accident, that excess shall be paid by the insurer and shall be reimbursable to the insurer from the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1977, c.310 (C.39:6-73.1).  The policy form, which shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner, shall set forth the benefits provided under the policy, including eligible medical treatments, diagnostic tests and services as well as such other benefits as the policy may provide.  The commissioner shall set forth by regulation a statement of the basic benefits which shall be included in the policy.  Medical treatments, diagnostic tests, and services provided by the policy shall be rendered in accordance with commonly accepted protocols and professional standards and practices which are commonly accepted as being beneficial for the treatment of the covered injury.

protocols or protocols for the administration of diagnostic tests shall not be interpreted in such a manner as to preclude variance from the standard when warranted by reason of medical necessity.  The policy form may provide for the precertification of certain procedures, treatments, diagnostic tests, or other services or for the purchase of durable medical goods, as approved by the commissioner, provided that the requirement for precertification shall not be unreasonable, and no precertification requirement shall apply within ten days of the insured event.  The policy may provide that certain benefits provided by the policy which are in excess of the basic benefits required by the commissioner to be included in the policy may be subject to reasonable copayments in addition to the copayments provided for pursuant to subsection e. of this section, provided that the copayments shall not be unreasonable and shall be established in such a manner as not to serve to encourage underutilization of benefits subject to the copayments, nor encourage overutilization of benefits.  The policy form shall clearly set forth any limitations on benefits or exclusions, which may include, but need not be limited to, benefits which are otherwise compensable under workers' compensation, or benefits for treatments deemed to be experimental or investigational, or benefits

The commissioner shall establish standards for the certification of medical review organizations, which shall include standards of performance formulated by the commissioner in consultation with the Commissioner of Health and Senior Services. The standards of performance shall set forth procedures to ensure a timely and impartial review of the medical records of the injured person by a medical review organization, including, but not limited to, a review of the necessity or appropriateness of treatments for injuries, including diagnostic tests, sustained in an automobile accident.  The commissioner shall establish standards for persons conducting the medical review, including standards with respect to credentials, experience, licensure, fees, and confidentiality.  The standards shall include a requirement that all persons performing reviews are New Jersey licensed or certified health care providers, and a requirement that any medical review panel contain a health care provider licensed or certified in the same profession as the treating health care provider and that it contain a sufficient representation of reviewers to judge the appropriateness of treatment or treatments in dispute, including, but not limited to, the medical necessity of such treatments, appropriateness of the protocols used by the treating provider, issues regarding causality and preexisting conditions, the appropriateness and efficacy of diagnostic tests performed in connection with the diagnosis, and whether the diagnostic tests meet the requirements established by the commissioner.  The commissioner may contract with a consultant for the formulation of the standards governing the certification of the persons conducting the medical reviews.  The commissioner shall not advertise for bids for the consultant, as provided in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.1954, c.48 (C.52:34-8 and 52:34-9).   b.   Before certifying a medical review organization to receive referrals from dispute resolution proceedings, the commissioner shall determine that the organization has a sufficient number of qualified health care providers, by specialty, to perform the reviews, has a satisfactory procedure for maintaining the confidentiality of medical records, is not owned or controlled by an insurer, and has met any other requirements established by the commissioner.   c.   The medical review organization shall establish and utilize written review procedures, which shall be filed with the commissioner.  Every determination made by a medical review organization shall be in writing and shall be retained by the organization for a period of no less than five years.   d.   The medical review organization may review the medical treatment or treatments in dispute to determine whether: (1) the treatment or diagnostic test being given for the injury or the services provided in connection with the injury is medically necessary; (2) the treatment is in accordance with or compatible with medically recognized standard protocols, professional standards, and commonly accepted medical practice in the same health care discipline as the treating provider; (3) the treatment is consistent with the symptoms or diagnosis of the injury; (4) the treatment or health care service is related to the injury sustained in the insured event, or is required for the diagnosis, evaluation or confirmation of the injury; (5) the treatment is of a palliative, rather than restorative, nature; and (6) medical procedures, treatment, or testing which have been repeated are medically necessary and consistent with standard practice.   e.   Cases referred by a dispute resolution professional for medical review shall be referred to appropriate certified medical reviewers affiliated with the certified medical review organization by a dispute resolution organization. The dispute resolution organization shall forward the referrals to certified medical reviewers on a random basis, so that there is a relatively equal apportionment among all medical reviewers.  Referrals shall be made in such a manner so as not to disclose to the medical reviewers the identity of the insurer, nor shall the identity of the reviewer be disclosed to the insurer.   f.   When appropriate in the context of its review of services or treatments under dispute, a medical reviewer may request and shall receive a written report or copy of the provider's records regarding the case history, treatment dates, or the dates diagnostic tests or other services were performed, and the provider's projected treatment plan. The injured person or provider, as applicable, shall provide or make available to the medical reviewer any pertinent medical records or medical history which the medical reviewer may request. The medical reviewer shall complete its review and make a determination within 20 business days of receipt of all of the requested information from the dispute resolution professional or provider, as the case may be.  The medical reviewer shall submit its determination in writing to the referring dispute resolution organization, which shall forward it to the dispute resolution professional.   g.   The cost of the proceedings shall be apportioned by the dispute resolution professional.  Fees shall be determined to be reasonable if they are consonant with the amount of the award, in accordance with a schedule established by the New Jersey Supreme Court.  If the treatment, diagnostic test, or service performed is not determined to be medically necessary or appropriate, the injured person shall not be liable to pay the provider the disputed amount.   L.1998,c.21,s.25."},{"id":"39:6A-5.3","title":"Definitions relative to electronic submission of certain automobile insurance claims.","body":""},{"id":"39:6A-5.4","title":"Electronic bills.","body":""},{"id":"39:6A-5.5","title":"Inapplicability.","body":""},{"id":"39:6A-6","title":"Collateral source.","body":"6.   Collateral Source.

program.     The Legislature further finds and declares that the standards established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency are based on computer modeling and not on scientific testing; that the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency regulations therefore may not achieve the federal emission reduction goals for New Jersey; and that officials of the Environmental Protection Agency are no longer mandating that the State program require the use of the \"I/M 240\" test and have recently expressed a greater flexibility in allowing states to make certain decisions in the implementation of this enhanced inspection and maintenance program.     The Legislature further finds and declares that the inspection and maintenance program being imposed by the Environmental
